        A test for LP bug #704854 -- Exception thrown by registry
        server is consumed by API server.

        We start both servers daemonized.

        meet validation requirements on the registry server and test
        that the error returned from the API server to curl is appropriate

        We also fire the glance-upload tool against the API server
